## Development server


Run `ipconfig` then copy `IPv4 Address` from there under `Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi`

Replace `apiurl` in [environment.ts](src/environments/environment.ts),[environment.dev.ts](src/environments/environment.dev.ts) and [environment.prod.ts](src/environments/environment.prod.ts) with `http://<YOUR_IPV4_ADDRESS>:8181`

Run `ng serve --host <YOUR_IPV4_ADDRESS>` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://<YOUR_IPV4_ADDRESS>:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
